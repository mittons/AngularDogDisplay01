Similar to the majority of the previous projects that this project is based on, AngularDogDisplay01 is a project I made with the intention of personal skill consolidation/refining, as well as a career portfolio project.

But at the same time this is also my first experience with Angular. Heavily based on the same functionality/patterns as the previous iterations (only a few discrepancies), but in a new language, so beyond simple skill consolidation/refining, this was also a massive learning experience.
